	<h1>Shogun review: Awesome to look at but overstuffed, Japanese historical epic is a grounded alternative to Game of Thrones</h1>
	<p>Breathtaking to behold, but at the same time, almost too unwieldy to comprehend, FX’s Shogun is an inconsistent affair whose downsides ultimately outweigh its achievements. Based on a book by James Clavell — the author whose historical fictions tended to be over a thousand pages long and exclusively about white people in Asian territories — Shogun is a sprawling epic that, an effort to spread the love, sacrifices what is often the most important thing in storytelling: a point-of-view.</p>
	<p>For all intents and purposes, British sailor John Blackthorne is given the standard heroes journey, but there’s something not quite right about asking the audience to latch onto the sole white man in a story set entirely in feudal Japan. And creators Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks appear to have regonised this. At a conservative estimate, about 70% of Shogun is in the Japanese language, which is highly unusual for an American production. This is also a welcome change from the 1980 NBC adaptation of Clavell’s novel, which avoided subtitles altogether. The filmmakers argued that they wanted to put audiences in Blackthorne’s shoes. The 10-episode mini-series, which is being aired in India on Disney+ Hotstar, actively pushes back against this approach.</p>
	<p>Toranaga is quick to realise that Blackthorne might be the perfect pawn in his efforts to protect himself against mounting pressure from his rivals. It’s common knowledge that Toranaga’s growing influence has isolated him from the other ‘daimyos’. He summons Blackthorne, then a prisoner in Yabushige’s territory, to meet with him in Osaka. And after a couple of adventures — Blackthorne proves himself to be a worthy soldier — Toranaga develops a trust for his new plaything, eventually elevating him to the position of samurai.</p>
