	<h1>How Hardik Pandya managed to get a Grade A BCCI central contract</h1>
	<p>Even as the decision to omit Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan from the central contracts list for not turning up for domestic tournaments continues to receive mixed reactions, there was plenty of discussion about Hardik Pandya’s inclusion as well. The Indian Express understands that the selectors and the BCCI only handed Hardik a contract after the all-rounder gave an undertaking that if there are no white-ball commitments with the national team, he would feature for Baroda in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s and Vijay Hazare Trophy.</p>
	<p>During the recent meeting, apart from Shreyas and Ishan, there was discussion regarding Pandya’s place in Grade A of the annual contract list as well. Since injuring his ankle during the World Cup in October, Pandya had remained out of action till last week when he returned to competitive cricket in the DY Patil tournament, where he is turning out for Reliance. Like Ishan, Pandya has been training individually in Vadodara, but what worked in his favour is that he has been reporting at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) on a time-to-time basis to have his fitness assessed.</p>
	<p>According to a top BCCI official, Pandya has also given assurance that he would feature in domestic tournaments if they don’t overlap with international commitments. “We have had discussions with Pandya, who has been told to play domestic white-ball tournaments when he is available. At this stage, according to the assessment of the BCCI’s medical team, he is not in a position to bowl in red-ball tournaments. So playing Ranji Trophy is out of the equation for Pandya. But he has to play other white-ball tournaments if there are no India commitments.</p>
