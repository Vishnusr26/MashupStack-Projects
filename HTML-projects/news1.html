	<h1>DDA razes house of man who led team that rescued 41 from Uttarakhand tunnel</h1>
	<p>On Wednesday, he came home to find that it was being demolished as part of an anti-encroachment drive by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) at Sri Ram Colony in Northeast Delhi’s Khajuri Khas area.</p>
	<p>“They (the authorities) came for demolition today morning; my wife and I were not at home, only my children were there. I rushed back, tried telling them not to go ahead, but they didn’t listen,” Hasan, 45, who also owns Rockwell Enterprises, the company that employed the “rat-hole” miners, said.</p>
	<p>In an official statement, the DDA said, “On 28.02.2024, a demolition drive was conducted to remove encroachment from acquired land in village Khajuri Khas. The land was part of planned development land.”</p>
	<p>Recalling the rescue mission in November, Hasan, the father of three minor children, said, “We didn’t think about our lives and got the work done. We are not asking for money, all I ask for is that I have the house I was living in. Where do we go with the children? Kiraya dena humare bas ka hai nahi… doosra, ek dum se koi kiraye par makaan milega nahin (We can’t pay rent, we also won’t be able to find a place on rent immediately).”</p>
